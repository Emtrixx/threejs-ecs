# threejs-ecs

Playground for me to try out three.js and implement Game Engine from scratch

You can try out a prototype in your browser but it is still unstable:
[Play](https://zombie.dorm-hub.de/ "Zombie Game")

For a local environment pull the repo and run 
```
npm install 
```

Afterwards run
```
npm run dev
```
to start dev environment, by default the site be reachable under localhost:3000.
